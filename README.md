# JetsProject

## Description
Welcome to my JetsProject where you can read a list of jets from a text file and display them onto the console, you are able to modify the list by adding or removing which ever aircraft you select. You are also able to view which aircraft is the fastest, how long each one can fly for, the aircraft with the longest range and you are able to activate specific functions of each aircrafts type!

## Technologies Used
Java, file I/O, casting, abstract methods, interface, List, ArrayList


## Lessons Learned
I learned how to properly use abstract classes, when and why to use interfaces, how to read from a text file and split comma separated lines to store the data into an array list. I passed the scanner through the parameters of a method in order to get more practice in passing data through parameters because that was something I was not as comfortable with as I should be.
